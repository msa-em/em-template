This article is a template for the [Elemental Microscopy](https://www.elementalmicroscopy.com/) journal. This journal is focused on educational and informative content, using a highly interactive platform built on modern web technologies. Our articles are written with a combination of: 


* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org)
* [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org)
* [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org)
* [BibTeX](https://mystmd.org/guide/citations#including-bibtex)
* [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com)

Articles should focus on educational or methodological topics. In the future we will publish original research on this platform, and move many of these features to our sister journals. Your abstract should provide a succinct and clear outline of your paper.
